# getSNPrs Bug Fix Summary

## Issue Fixed
**Error**: `syntax error in expression (error token is "0")` occurring during report generation

## Root Cause
The arithmetic expression `$(( found_snps * 100 / total_snps ))` was failing because:
1. Variables could be empty or contain non-numeric values
2. Division by zero when `total_snps` was 0
3. Invalid variable values when report data was missing

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. Enhanced Variable Validation
- Added regex validation for all numeric variables
- Set default values (0) for empty variables
- Added error checking before arithmetic operations

### 2. Safe Arithmetic Operations
```bash
# Before (problematic):
success_rate=$(( found_snps * 100 / total_snps ))

# After (safe):
local success_rate=0
if [ "$total_snps" -gt 0 ] && [[ "$found_snps" =~ ^[0-9]+$ ]] && [[ "$total_snps" =~ ^[0-9]+$ ]]; then
    success_rate=$(( found_snps * 100 / total_snps ))
fi
```

### 3. Improved Report Data Handling
- Added checks for temp report file existence
- Better error handling when report data is missing
- Fallback to basic report when detailed data unavailable

### 4. Enhanced Input Processing
- Better line counting that excludes empty lines
- Improved error handling for malformed input
- Debug information for troubleshooting

## Files Modified
- `getSNPrs.sh` - Main script with bug fixes
- `Readme.md` - Updated troubleshooting section
- `test_arithmetic_fix.sh` - New test script for validation

## Testing
The fix has been validated to handle:
- ✅ Empty input files
- ✅ Files with no matching SNPs
- ✅ Missing report data
- ✅ Invalid numeric values
- ✅ Division by zero scenarios

## Backward Compatibility
All existing functionality remains unchanged. The fixes only improve error handling and don't affect normal operation.

## Additional Improvements
- Added debug information for troubleshooting
- Better error messages for users
- Fallback mechanisms for edge cases
- Enhanced input validation
